# What is Algorithmic Trading?

"Algorithmic trading is a process for executing orders utilizing automated and pre-programmed trading instructions to account for variables such as price, timing and volume. An algorithm is a set of directions for solving a problem. Computer algorithms send small portions of the full order to the market over time." - Investopedia.

## Вasic concepts

Algorithmic trading means that the decision to buy or sell financial securities on the stock exchange is made based on a predetermined algorithm, with the intent to make a profit. On our platform, it is a python script that takes historical data as an input and gives a decision to buy/sell stock as output.

Say we have a capital $1M and want to invest in a portfolio consisting of three stocks: Apple Inc (AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class C (GOOG), Tesla Inc (TSLA). Let's have a look at the open price of these stocks for some period. Open is the price at which a security first trades upon the opening of an exchange on a trading day. We use historical data from the NASDAQ exchange as input:

| date         | AAPL   | GOOG     | TSLA   |
|:------------:| ------:| --------:| ------:|
| Mar 02, 2020 | 282.28 | 1,351.61 | 711.26 |
| Mar 03, 2020 | 303.67 | 1,399.42 | 805.00 |
| Mar 04, 2020 | 296.44 | 1,359.23 | 763.96 |

_Table 1: Stock open price in USD. NASDAQ exchange._

Now we need to come up with an algorithm by which our capital will be allocated between stocks. The algorithm is an intelligent search of some world event reflected in data. Usually, it is based on some idea. Suppose we have a hypothesis - invest more if open price is low. A hypothesis can be expressed through the formula:


```math
\label{alpha1}
    \frac{1}{\textbf{open}},
```

Hereinafter we will stand bold symbols for vectors. We can receive a matrix form of the algorithm by applying formula (2) to the table 1:

| date         | AAPL          | GOOG          | TSLA          |
|:------------:| -------------:| -------------:| -------------:|
| Mar 02, 2020 | 0.00354258183 | 0.00073985839 | 0.00140595562 |
| Mar 03, 2020 | 0.00329304837 | 0.00071458175 | 0.00124223602 |
| Mar 04, 2020 | 0.00337336391 | 0.00073571065 | 0.00130896905 |

_Table 2: Matrix form of the algorithm._

Capital is distributed in proportion to the values of the matrix. To receive the shares of capital invested in each stock, the matrix (table 2) must be normalized  ``$` l_1 `$``) norm) to one for each day:

| date         | AAPL   | GOOG   | TSLA   |
|:------------:| ------:| ------:| ------:|
| Mar 02, 2020 | 0.6228 | 0.1301 | 0.2472 |
| Mar 03, 2020 | 0.6273 | 0.1361 | 0.2366 |
| Mar 04, 2020 | 0.6226 | 0.1358 | 0.2416 |

_Table 3: Final weights of the algorithm._

Thus, $1M·0.6228 = $622,800 was allocated for AAPL on Mar 02, 2020; GOOG and TSLA received $130,100 and $247,200 correspondingly. Matrix values (3) are called weights of the algorithm.

## Long Position vs. Short Position
----------------------------------

To sell a stock, one just needs to assign it a negative weight in the algorithm.Assume, you have the following weights:

|date          | AAPL | GOOG | TSLA |
| ------------ | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Mar 02, 2020 | 0.4  |  0.4 | -0.2 |


The positive sign means that we hold a long position (buy shares); the
negative sign means we hold a short position (sell shares). Thus, the
capital 1M will be allocated in the following proportions:
$400,000 to AAPL; $400,000 to GOOG; $-200,000 to TSLA.

**Details**

For our platform, we use a simplified treatment of short positions and
mirror long positions. For a real-environment trading one needs to
remember that short positions are associated with higher risks. An
investor selling shares that he does not yet own (as a rule, from his
broker's account) is obligated to buy them back after a while. Thus, the
investor expects a fall in prices and plays against the market. It leads
to several risks:

-   Some stocks are hard to borrow. The reason is high demand, a limited
    number of securities and so on. For a short position for such
    securities, the broker charges an additional fee.

-   The short seller is responsible for paying dividends on shares to
    the person from whom they were borrowed.

-   The potential losses in a short sale can be endless, because
    theoretically the maximum price of shares is unlimited. On the other
    hand, the share price will not fall below zero, so the maximum
    profit is limited.

-   Even if the estimate is correct, the moment may be inappropriate. It
    is extremely unprofitable to hold a short position at a rising price
    for a long time.

## Relative returns

The investment portfolio is redistributed according to the algorithm
once a day (the exchange has 252 working days a year). Redistribution
occurs at the beginning of the day. For our platform, we assume that the
purchase of shares occurs at the *open* price.

Equity grows with the correct prediction of price changes. The daily
change in equity is estimated after the end of the trading day and
strongly depends on the *close* price. *Close* is the price at which a
security last trades on a trading day.

Algorithm results, calculated on historical data, are usually presented
on an equity graph in order to understand the behaviour of the
cumulative profit. In our platform, we set initial equity to 1, so it
can be scaled easily.


![pnl](pnl.png)
_Pic. 1_


Relative returns simply indicate how much the capital has changed. For
the ``$`i^{th}`$`` day we introduce the relative returns (rr) in unit
fractions:

```math
\label{equity1}
    \text{rr}[i] = \frac{\text{equity}[i]}{\text{equity}[i-1]} - 1,
```

**Details**

Sometimes it's important to understand how equity (cumulative profit,
PnL) is calculated. Say we allocate our capital in a proportion to the
vector of *weights* for the ``$`i^{th}`$`` day. Thus we buy shares at *open*
price and receive the following positions:

```math
\label{position}
    \textbf{pos}[i] = \left( \textbf{weights}[i]\cdot\text{equity}[i] \right)/\textbf{open}[i],
```

where bold variables stand for vectors in the space of shares; division
is elementwise. For the next day, an algorithm will generate a new
vector of ``$`\textit{weigths}[i+1]`$`` that will redistribute our capital
into new positions. Redistribution of portfolio instruments leads to
capital losses associated mainly with the broker's commission and the
*slippage*.

It is quite clear that the greater part of the capital we must
redistribute, the more broker's commission affects our profit. For real
trading, slippage has a more significant impact on profit than the
commission, so in our platform, we only consider slippage.

What is the slippage? We need a buyer/seller to sell/buy any shares. If
there is no offer on the exchange, the order is opened at a new price.
Thus, we buy the desired number of shares in parts, using offers to
buy/sell a specific number of shares at a specific price. We calculate
*slippage* according to the following formula:

```math
\label{slappage}
    \text{slippage}[i] = abs(\textbf{pos}[i] - \textbf{pos}[i-1])\cdot \textbf{ATR}(14) \cdot 0.05,
```
where ``$` \textbf{ATR}(14) `$`` - is a market volatility indicator. The Average True Range (``$` \textbf{ATR}(N) `$``) indicator is a moving average (MA) over N
days of the true range (**TR**) values:

```math
\begin{gathered}
\label{ATR}
    \textbf{TR}[i] = max(
\textbf{high}[i] - \textbf{low}[i]; \textbf{high}[i] - \textbf{close}[i-1]; \textbf{close}[i-1] - \textbf{low}[i]), \end{gathered}
```

```math
\label{ATR2}
    \textbf{ATR}(N) = MA(\textbf{TR},N).
```

Now we can introduce the equity formula for the i day:

```math
\begin{gathered}
    \text{equity}[i] = \text{equity}[i - 1] + (\textbf{open}[i] - \textbf{close}[i-1]) \cdot \\ \textbf{pos}[i-1] + (\textbf{close}[i] - \textbf{open}[i]) \cdot \textbf{pos}[i] - \text{slippage}[i]
    \label{equity}\end{gathered}
```

## Algorithm quality
------------------

Once we have constructed an algorithm and plotted an equity on a historical data, we need to use a set of criteria to evaluate the performance. All current competition rules are available [here](https://quantnet.ai/contest).

### Sharpe Ratio

First, to estimate the profitability of the algorithm, we measure the Sharpe ratio (SR), the most important and popular metric. For our platform, we use the annualized SR and assume that there is ≈252 trading days on average per year. The annual SR formula for N days is presented below:

```math
\label{SR_final_first}
    \text{SR} = \frac{\sqrt[N]{[\prod\limits_{i=1}^{N} (rr_i + 1)]^{252}} - 1}{\sqrt{\frac{252}{N}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} (rr_{i}  - \overline{rr}) }},
```

where ``$` rr_i `$`` stands for the daily relative returns (of the i'th day),
``$`\overline{rr}`$`` denotes the expected value.

The numerator is an average daily return. The book size changes with the size of equity, thus the numerator is a geometric mean.

The denominator is a standard deviation of the portfolio’s excess return. Another way to think about the denominator is that it means volatility.

Thus, the Sharpe ratio is the return per unit of risk (volatility). The greater the Sharpe ratio, the better (Fig.2). To submit a strategy successfully, the SR should be higher than 1 over the last 3 years.

![Sharpe low](low_sharpe.png)
![Sharpe high](high_sharpe.png)
Figure 2: Equity charts for different algorithms. Upper: ``$` \text{SR} = 1.28 `$``.
Lower: ``$` \text{SR} = 7.62 `$``


**Details**

In 1994, William Sharpe defined the Sharpe ratio as:

```math
\label{SR_1}
    \text{SR} = \frac{E(R_p - R_f)}{\sigma_p},
```
    
where ``$` R_p `$`` - return of the portfolio
, ``$` R_f `$`` - risk-free rate, ``$` E(R_p - R_f) `$`` - s the expected value of the excess of the portfolio return over the benchmark return,
``$` \sigma_p `$`` - standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return. We
assume risk-free rate to be zero (alternative way to compute the Sharpe ratio is to set S&P 500 total return as a risk-free rate). For N trading days:
 
```math
 \label{SR_2}
    \text{SR} = \frac{\text{average daily return}}{\text{daily volatility}} = \frac{\sqrt[N]{\prod\limits_{i=1}^{N} (rr_i + 1)} - 1}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} (rr_{i}  - \overline{rr}) }},
```

where ``$` \overline{rr} `$`` - denotes the expected value of relative returns. The book size changes with the size of equity, thus the numerator is a geometric mean. Now we introduce the SR, scaled on an arbitrary period ``$` T `$``:

```math
\label{SR_final}
    \text{SR} = \frac{\sqrt[N]{[\prod\limits_{i=1}^{N} (rr_i + 1)]^T} - 1}{\sqrt{\frac{T}{N}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} (rr_{i}  - \overline{rr}) }}.
```

For annual Sharpe ratio one can put T= 252 - trading days per year. We use annual (T= 252) Sharpe ratio (11) to estimate algorithms on our platform.

### Uniqueness

  Every good trading algorithm is a signal that reflects the imperfection of the market. The more capital involved in the signal, the less marginal this signal. A good algorithm must minimize intersection with well-known and already existing signals. Uniqueness can be defined as a maximum correlation of the algorithm to the pool of the existing algorithms: 

```math
r_{XY} = \frac{\text{cov}_{\textbf{X}\textbf{Y}}}{\sigma_{\textbf{X}} \sigma_{\textbf{Y}}} = \frac{\sum (\textbf{X} - \overline{\textbf{X}})(\textbf{Y} - \overline{\textbf{Y}})}{\sqrt{\sum (\textbf{X} - \overline{\textbf{X}})^2(\textbf{Y} - \overline{\textbf{Y}})^2}}
```

where ``$` \textbf{X}, \textbf{Y} `$`` are daily relative returns. The lower the correlation, the better. According to the rules, your algorithm must have a correlation coefficient lower than 0.9 over the last 3 years; otherwise, you need to have the largest Sharpe ratio among the correlated algorithms.

### Diversification of risks

It is worth to use a few instruments for the trading algorithm. Even if the strategy is right, unpredictable world events/news may cause irreparable damage (for instance, 
[1](https://www.ft.com/content/be040b3a-5c96-11ea-b0ab-339c2307bcd4) and
[2](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/03/06/russias-tinkoff-bank-shares-fall-as-founder-indicted-in-us-a69538)).

A good way to diversify risks is to increase the number of instruments in the investment portfolio. After that we can set a maximum stock weight to 0.05. It means that we will allocate no more than 5% of our equity to the each stock.

There are many such news every year - they merge with the information noise and we forget them. However, they are reflected in historical data and strongly affect profit in the future. According to the rules, your algorithm must pass [exposure filter](https://quantnet.ai/documentation/ru/available_functions/evaluation.html#exposure-filter). You can use the suggested [tools](https://quantnet.ai/documentation/ru/available_functions/improve_algorithm.html#exposures-improving) to avoid filtering out the algorithm due to exposure filter.

## Is and Os
-------

  Overfitting is easy. If one tries a significant amount of algorithm
  configurations, backtest can be fitted to any desired performance. The
  number of guidelines can help to avoid overfitting and estimate a real
  algorithm value.

**In sample**

  By \"sample\" we mean a data sample. Thus, *in-sample* (IS) is an
  observed historical data, an analogue of the training set in machine
  learning. In order to prevent overfitting, one can test the model using
  a longer history or improve *in-sample* requirements.

**Out of sample**

  The *out-of-sample* (OS) is an analogue of the testing set in machine
  learning. It is real-time data. We take each algorithm, test it day by
  day in a real environment and monitor its performance. It is wrong when
  an algorithm changes its strategy with time. All conditions must be
  consistent.

**Competition**

  Say you are participating in QuantNet Contest in the 6 months competition and create an algorithm for stock trading. According to the rules, you have a good Sharpe (>1) and low correlation (<0.9) over the previous 3 years. The backtest for this 3 years is in-sample (Fig.3). Say we measure SR in-sample - SR_IS. The real time test for 6 months is out-of-sample and gives SR_OS. All strategies are rated by min(SR_IS, SR_OS). The larger the better.

## Improving the algorithm
### Neutralization
--------------

 Let's analyse the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on
stock exchanges in the United States. The so called index S&P500. As
one can see, the market growth on average. S&P500 return varies widely
from a few percent to over 20% in some
[years](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/18/the-sp-500-has-already-met-its-average-return-for-a-full-year.html).
Does it mean that simply opening a long positions is a good idea?

![sp500](snp500.png)


Despite the growth, the Sharpe ratio of S&P500 is less than 1. One of
the main reason - periodic financial crises. There are some of them:

-   1987 year. "Black Monday." The Dow Jones Index fell 22.6% in the
    United States. The reason is the massive outflow of investors from
    regional markets.

-   2000-2003. The Crash of the Dotcoms. The crisis caused by the
    massive investment of money in Internet projects.

-   2007--2008. Great Recession. The combination of banks unable to
    provide funds to businesses, and homeowners paying down debt rather
    than borrowing and spending, resulted in the Great Recession that
    began in the U.S. officially in December 2007 and lasted until June
    2009, thus extending over 19 months.

The consequences of crises are visible on the chart and appear as market
drops of up to 30%. It is dangerous to think that the crisis is horror
stories from the past. The beginning of 2020 is marked by the fall of
the economy caused by Coronavirus.

**Neutralization**

We can exclude the market influence by balancing long/short positions
for our algorithm. So, it will be a market-neutral. The neutralization
could be done for the whole market or each industry (or smaller group).
Mathematically, market neutralization is elementary.

Say, we a have a vector of **weights<sub>i</sub>** for i day, given by
the algorithm. In order to make the algorithm a market-neutral, one
needs to apply the following equation for each day:

**neutralized\_weights<sub>i</sub>** = **weights<sub>i</sub>** - mean(**weights<sub>i</sub>**).

Now the mean of weights for each day is zero. It means that we neither
invest money nor withdraw it from the market.
