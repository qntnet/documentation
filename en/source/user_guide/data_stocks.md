## Available instruments
Let's download information about the instruments available for trading for the previous 5 years:

```python
import qnt.data as qndata 
import datetime as dt

assets = qndata.load_assets(tail=dt.timedelta(days=5*365))
```
или
```python
assets = qndata.load_assets(min_date="2015-01-01")
```

There are 1002 financial instruments available. For each of them, brief information is provided:

```python
assets[0]

```python

## Market data

> We recommend using data from 2015. Market share prices have been available since 2000.

To download market data, just use the following function:

```python
import qnt.data    as qndata
import datetime    as dt

data = qndata.load_data(tail = dt.timedelta(days = 4*365),
                        forward_order = True)

price_open = data.sel(field="open")
price_close = data.sel(field="close")
price_high = data.sel(field="high")
price_low = data.sel(field="low")
volume_day = data.sel(field="vol")
is_liquid = data.sel(field="is_liquid")
```

| Data name | Description |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| open               | Open is the price at which a security first trades upon the opening of an exchange on a trading day. Daily open price. |
| close              | Daily close price. |
| high               | Daily high price. |
| low                | Daily low price. |
| vol                | Daily volume of trading in number of shares.|
| divs               | Dividends from shares. |
| split              | It indicates stock split. Split = 2.0 means that on this day there was a split of shares 2 to 1: the number of shares doubled, and their price halved. |
| split\_cumprod     | split\_cumprod  & The product of split values from the very beginning. Used to restore original prices. |
| is\_liquid         | We trade only liquid stocks, so this option determines whether this stock can be traded. This is top 500 most liquid stocks over the last month (sorted by trading volume = sum(close*vol) ). It changes once a month. |

**Uploading certain companies**
-------------------

You can also limit the data loading by specifying the tools that interest you. In the **assets_names** variable, specify the **companies** you want to **trade**.

For example, you can generate a list of previously downloaded assets:
```python
assets_names = [i["id"] for i in assets]
```
Or set the companies manually:

```python
assets_names=['NASDAQ:AAPL', 'NASDAQ:GOOGL']

data = qndata.load_data(tail = dt.timedelta(days = 5*365),
                        assets=assets_names,
                        forward_order = True)

price_open = data.sel(field="open")   
```

```python
price_open.to_pandas().tail()
```
